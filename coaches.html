                                    <p class="coach-description">Rob has been immersed in the rugby world since 2005, and his passion for the sport is unmistakable the moment he starts talking about it. Over the years, he has twice stepped into the role of head coach, bringing steady leadership and a deep understanding of the game to each team he's guided. Away from the pitch, Rob is an avid outdoorsman and hunter, a balance that mirrors the calm, grounded presence he brings to coaching. Rob's coaching style is defined by a quiet confidence and a high rugby IQ. He has a knack for breaking down complex strategies and teaching the finer points of the game in a way players can absorb and apply. His composed demeanor, paired with his strategic insight, creates an environment where athletes can grow, think, and compete at a higher level.</p>

                                    <p class="coach-description">Sam found Winona Men's Rugby by accident when he started out at college. Originally, Sam was training to walk on to the football team until he was invited to a practice while working out at the IWC. One practice was all it took to get Sam hooked as he loved the intensity, hitting, and team bond that extended past the pitch. Over the five years that Sam played, he saw lots of transitions between coaches and eventually the year 2020 rolled around and Winona Men's Rugby was without a coach and at a crossroads with the unprecedented pandemic. At this time, Sam stepped into the role of player-coach until his time at Winona State came to an end in 2021. The experience of being a player coach was difficult for Sam but he learned valuable lessons and only reinforced the love that he has for coaching. </p>

                                    <p class="coach-description">Jake discovered Winona Men's rugby while looking for a sport to play in college, joining the team with no experience after a high-school background in football and track. His first season was a crash course in a completely new sport, but the intensity, physicality, and brotherhood hooked him. He went on to spend five years in the forward pack. A few years after graduating, Jake returned to the Winona Men's, this time as a coach. Working alongside an assistant coach, he helped guide and manage the team for two seasons. His coaching reflects his own journey: supportive of newcomers, committed to hard work, and focused on building the same sense of unity that made him fall in love with the game.</p>
