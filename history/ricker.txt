During the Dogg beginning it was quite evident that they needed a pre-game cheer. It was embarrassing to listen to the other teams get pumped up, and the Doggs just take the field. So with a need comes creativity.
Roommates Steve Yaglowski (wing forward), and Mike Rusk (# 8), started trying to put something together. It was a nice spring day in Winona, and classes had just ended for the day. Yago & Rusker started up a game of acey deucey backgammon, brewed a pot of coffee, put on Looney Tunes, and enjoyed some of the finer things in life. As they both sat there and blurted out things, nothing sounded DOGGISH enough. That was until it came on the TV……A Bugs Bunny cartoon. Keep your eye open for it. It’s Bugs, and a horse. Bugs is messing with the horse, get’s him in some bleachers, and begins a cheer.  The cheer begins  “Ricker racker…”** At that time Yago & Rusker look at each other, and say THAT’S IT!!!
So they added the Dogg twist to the end of it. Knowing that the cheer was too short, the creative juices kept flowing. It was about 10 more minutes before they developed a DOGGISH follow-up to the Bugs Bunny cheer.  Then to finish it off with a DOGGISH ending, and added the three Dogg barks at the end.
They took the cheer to the team the next day, and the team loved it. Plus nobody else had come up with anything. From that day on, the Dogg cheer was established.
I will let everyone know that Yago, Rusker, and all of the original Doggs take pride in the fact that our cheer is still alive & kick’n. Keep it rolling boys!!!!!!
